Igloo Version 4

Igloo is an open-source application designed to improve workflows for desktop support professionals and systems administrators. With its simple and intuitive command set, Igloo allows users to configure VPN clients, modify firewall settings, install Windows Server feature sets with a single command, collect SSH command output from a list of network devices, configure advanced TCP/IP settings, and more- all without the need to click through GUI windows or research esoteric PowerShell commands.

Igloo uses a command structure similar to Cisco IOS - that is, it is comprised of commands and sub-commands in a tree structure. Enter an incomplete command or use '?' after a command to see more options.
