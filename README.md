# igloo v4

Igloo simplifies Windows administration by offering pre-made aliases for lengthy PowerShell commands. For example, displaying outbound firewall rules in PowerShell uses the following syntax:
```
Get-NetFirewallRule -Direction Out -Enabled True | Sort-Object -Property DisplayName
```
This is unwieldy and unnecessarily long, and further piping into Select-Object would be required for clean output. The equivalent command in Igloo is as follows:
```
igloo~$ show fwall out
```
In addition to Windows aliases, Igloo offers a variety of admin tools to help automate your workflows. For example, SSH output can be captured into dynamically-named files - perfect for config backups on compatible operating systems:
```
igloo~$ ssh write ios
input~! Specify the path to your device list: C:\Users\myuser\dev.txt
input~!  Specify the destination directory path: C:\Device Files\
input~! Enter a 'show' command: show version | in Version
input~! Enter a username: ssh-username
Password: [This is the SSH password prompt]

notify~! Saving file 10.0.0.1.txt...
notify~! Saving file 10.0.0.254.txt...
notify~! Saving file my-router.txt...
notify~! Saving file your-router.txt...
```

Igloo was created with sysadmins in mind. Grab your NATâ€™d IP address or configure your routing table with ease:
```
igloo~$ show ip public
notify~! Your translated address is [Output Omitted]

igloo~$ ip route 172.16.1.0/24 10.0.0.1 9 metric 15
igloo~$ ip route 10.200.0.0/16 192.168.1.254 9
```
Igloo also enables granular client VPN configuration without the fuss of GUIs or lengthy PowerShell commands:

```
igloo~$ crypto ipsec aes256 sha256 group14
conf~$ Name the vpn connection: myvpn
conf~$ Enter the IP address of your vpn server: 1.1.1.1

notify~! Creating VPN adapter...
notify~! Configuring encryption, hash, and DH group options...
notify~! IPSec VPN 'myvpn' has been created: [Output Omitted]
```
