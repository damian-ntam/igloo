Igloo makes life easy.

Version 4

Igloo is an open-source application designed to improve workflows for Windows
and network admins. It uses Python and PowerShell to simplify both common and
advanced configurations on Windows machines.

Granular configuration of Windows is typically achieved by PowerShell scripts
or cumbersome one-liners in the PowerShell console. General configurations re
-quire clicking through the GUI, which is time-consuming and tedious.

Igloo eliminates the need to research esoteric PowerShell command options or
click through countless GUI windows by providing users with a simple command-li
-ne interface with syntax that is both terse and easily understandable.

Thanks for giving Igloo a try. I hope it makes life easy.
