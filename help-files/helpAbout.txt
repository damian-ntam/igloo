Igloo makes life easy.

Version 4
10/03/2019

Igloo is an open-source application designed to improve workflows for desktop support professionals and 
systems administrators.

With its simple and intuitive command set, Igloo allows users to configure VPN clients, create firewall rules, 
install Windows Server features, collect SSH command output from a list of network devices, configure advanced 
TCP/IP settings, and more- all without the need to click through GUI windows or research esoteric PowerShell commands.

Enter an incomplete command or use '?' after a command to see more options.

Thanks for giving Igloo a try. I hope it makes life easy.
